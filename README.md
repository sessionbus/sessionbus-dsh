# sessionbus for DSH

`@sessionbus/dsh` connects DSH roots to sessionbus and runs daemon-managed DSH lanes.
Source and issue tracking live in
[sessionbus/sessionbus-dsh](https://github.com/sessionbus/sessionbus-dsh), and
daemon releases come from
[sessionbus/sessionbus](https://github.com/sessionbus/sessionbus/releases).
It depends on the exact `@sessionbus/kit` version `0.5.12`.
It supports DeepSeek Harness `0.1.5-rc.2` and later; tested versions are
`0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.6-alpha.1`, and `0.1.6-alpha.2`.
A DSH profile must install every DSH package at one uniform DSH version; adding
one prerelease package can otherwise pull newer prereleases through DSH's caret peers.
The default grant applies only to the `sessionbus` tool through DSH's
`tools/pre-execute` waterfall; every other tool continues through native DSH
permission policy. The waterfall is present since the `0.1.5-rc.2` peer floor.
`@sessionbus/dsh` is a pkg.pr.new preview until a separately reviewed trusted-
publishing workflow exists; its first registry version must be published manually
before trusted publishing can be configured.
The plugin reads the token once, deletes it from process.env, and retains it
nowhere in the plugin; DSH's immutable launch snapshot keeps it for the process
lifetime (trusted host).

## Installation

See [Installing a DSH lane host](docs/HOST-INSTALL.md) for the complete
preflight, installation, verification, and rollback procedure for
`@sessionbus/dsh` `0.1.0-pre.15` with kit `0.5.9`. It does not install or
validate `0.1.0-pre.16`. Dashi acceptance of pre.16 requires an
`@antst/dashi-app` release that pins `@sessionbus/dsh` `0.1.0-pre.16`.
The runbook's provider-parity step must be completed for both the lane and plain
peer profiles before either one runs a model turn.

Create the base-only lane profile for the package-owned `sessionbus-dsh`
product with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile sessionbus add @sessionbus/dsh && dsh plugin --profile sessionbus exec sessionbus-dsh-install
```

On a host that already uses dashi, one product can own both peers and lanes:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile sessionbus add @sessionbus/dsh && dsh plugin --profile sessionbus exec sessionbus-dsh-install --product dashi
```

In that form `SESSIONBUS_PRODUCTS` contains `dashi`, not `sessionbus-dsh`,
and the daemon maps it to `@antst/dashi-launcher`'s `dashi` bin.

Add the peer plugin to another profile, such as `web`, with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @sessionbus/dsh && dsh plugin --profile web exec sessionbus-dsh-install --product dsh web
```

The installer writes only profile-local rows and leaves an existing
`sessionbus` row's other fields unchanged while adding or updating its required
`product`. With no profile arguments it configures only the `sessionbus` lane
profile and derives product `sessionbus-dsh`. Use product `dashi` for the dashi
lane variant, `dsh` for a standalone web or custom peer profile, or another
stable operator-chosen identifier matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$`.
`@antst/dashi-app@0.1.0-alpha.20` and later own their dashi-profile row and
exact plugin dependency; do not run this installer against that profile.
Non-web profiles also receive the no-upload provider required by DSH's Session
Controller; ordinary text prompts work while file-upload receipts are rejected.

For the two-product form, register the daemon's `sessionbus-dsh` product as the
package's `sessionbus-dsh` bin. For the one-product form, register only `dashi`
as the `dashi` bin. Both launchers select the installed `sessionbus` profile
when given a launch token. Install the selected launcher alongside `dsh` at the
host level and put their shared `node_modules/.bin` on the daemon service's
`PATH`; the `dashi` launcher resolves its child `dsh` by name.

Without an explicit socket, peers use `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/sessionbus/presence.sock`
or `/tmp/sessionbus-<uid>/presence.sock`, matching the daemon's discovery rule.
Peer publication retries through the kit's reconnect path when the daemon is
unavailable, and each failed connection attempt writes one diagnostic line.
Set `SESSIONBUS_DSH_TRACE=1` to write one-line mode, readiness, root-lifecycle,
publication-gate, and socket-connection diagnostics to stderr; tracing is off
by default.

The lane advertises no native extra arguments. A non-empty `open.arguments`
request is rejected rather than silently ignored.

Uninstall without invoking DSH by running the installed bin from the profile:

```sh
pnpm --dir "$DSH_HOME/profiles/web" exec sessionbus-dsh-install --remove web
```

When the DSH CLI works, `dsh plugin --profile web exec
sessionbus-dsh-install --remove web` is the equivalent convenience form. The
installer removes the package first, then strips its managed `sessionbus` and
`file-uploads-none` rows. Managed rows carry an ownership comment; removal
refuses a matching unmarked row instead of deleting someone else's config.

`SESSIONBUS_GROUPS` configures peer identities only. Lane membership is owned
by the daemon; the plugin accepts and does not consume groups in `session.open`.

## Run results

A DSH error before its input commit returns `failed`, native stop reason `error`, and result `<code>: <message>` verbatim from the durable `turn/end`.

See [Lane without a TUI](docs/LANE-WITHOUT-TUI.md) for the daemon launch contract.
